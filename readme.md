# Quick Start Projects

This is my guide for starting projects quickly, mostly one liners, prebuilt skeletons, etc.

If I find myself looking up the commands or going to the docs repeatedly, I will try to add it here.

## MD Files

for commands, tips and tricks, view the md files for each topic. They will be set up as \<topic>.md

## JS/TS Files

for code snippets, view the js/ts files. They will be set up as \<langugage>-\<topic>.js/ts
> Many of the TS files will not include types, as they are just meant to be quick snippets.
You will find them in the `code` folder.
